Project Title:
Exploring the Relationship between Obesity cases and medical diseases in the United States

Project Description:
This project aims to explore the complex relationship between Obesity cases and medical diseases in the United States over the years. The primary objective is to create an interactive map that visually represents this relationship across different states, providing a user-friendly tool for users to understand the connection between Obesity cases and Medical diseases(such as cancer, Heart diseases, Strokes).

Project Goal:
The goal of this project is to deliver an insightful and functional interactive map that highlights the correlation between obesity cases and medical diseases across various U.S. states. This visual representation can serve as a valuable resource for government officials, policymakers, healthcare professionals, and insurance providers.

Main functions: The project involves the comprehensive collection of data from multiple sources, including the U.S. Census Bureau. We acquire detailed information related to health insurance coverage and median income across different states. The data is collected, processed, and integrated into a unified dataset. The core of our project is the creation of an interactive map. We leverage web development technologies and libraries to design and build an intuitive and user-friendly map interface which the states can be selected to show the obsity cases and the numbers for each types of diseases. 


Data sources: 
Characteristic Of Health Insurance:[Health Insurance Coverage in U.S](https://data.census.gov/table/ACSST1Y2022.S2701?q=health%20insurance)

This data set has the characteristics of health insurance in the United States. It has various variables including age, sex, race. 

Median Income: [Median Income In The Past 12 Months](https://data.census.gov/table/ACSST1Y2022.S1903?q=median%20household%20income%20by%20state)

This data set contributes to the median income in the past 12 months. We can also see previous years, but this is the other variable weâ€™re looking at to build the relationship.
