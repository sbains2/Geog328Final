Project Title:
Exploring the Relationship between Obesity cases and medical diseases in the United States

Project Description:
Overall, this project aims to uncover the intricate relationship between the overall obesity proportions as well as prevalent medical diseases in the United States throughout a 7 year period. Our focus is on the development of an interactive map that integrates HTML, CSS, and JS to convey these correlations across all states. Our prioritization is to give a user-friendly interface that can be easily interpreted to the relationship of obesity cases and the underlying medical conditions, including cancer, heart disease, and strokes. 

In terms of the JavaScript code, we employed Mapbox and Chart.js to dynamically project the temporal as well as the spatial trends. Some of the features include tooltips for state specific statistics over the period from 2010 - 2017. We implemented distinct color schemes in order to differentiate the disease statistics for Total Deaths, Total Cancer, Total Heart, and Total Stroke cases.

With regard to the HTML, we prioritized the optimal layout that would allow users to seamlessly utilize all the main functions and features of the map. Our corresponding CSS code aims to tailor not only to the broader functionality of the HTML and JS code, but to create an aesthetic appeal. Some specific features include the map overlay (or the legend) appearance, the navigation bar, as well as the overall coherence of the interface. In addition to this, we honed the hover functionality for the obesity proportion in order to convey the state statistics table. 



Project Goal:

One goal that we prioritized is the conductive temporal analyses spanning over a 7-year period throughout 2010-2017. Here, we integrate the nuanced spectrum of the obesity proportions aligning with their corresponding prevalent medica diseases. The perspective of the temporal analysis allows us to take a closer look at the distinctive patters with regards to the relationship between obesity and these underlying medical diseases in a more holistic view of health dynamics. 

Another prioritizing goal that led our project was creating a user-friendly design that highlights an intuitive and accessible design, so that users are given the freedom to navigate seamlessly throughout the site. Through ensuring these factors in our design, we hope to attract and empower a broader audience, which include government officials, insurance providers, and policymakers in order to easily perceive the relationship between obesity proportion statistics and underlying medical diseases. 

Our ambition through employing these focuses extends to cross-regional insights into deaths associated between obesity and underlying diseases. Through specializing the relationship between the two, it allows for a more targeted approach in terms of interventions in specific areas of the United States, allowing a further look into what diseases and solutions should be addressed. Furthermore, we hope to contribute to public health policies through these methods and provide tools to concerning stakeholders in the pursuit of healthcare management and tackling public health issues.

Main functions: The project involves the comprehensive collection of data from multiple sources, including the U.S. Census Bureau. We acquire detailed information related to health insurance coverage and median income across different states. The data is collected, processed, and integrated into a unified dataset. The core of our project is the creation of an interactive map. We leverage web development technologies and libraries to design and build an intuitive and user-friendly map interface which the states can be selected to show the obsity cases and the numbers for each types of diseases. 


Data sources: 
Characteristic Of Health Insurance:[Health Insurance Coverage in U.S](https://data.census.gov/table/ACSST1Y2022.S2701?q=health%20insurance)

This data set has the characteristics of health insurance in the United States. It has various variables including age, sex, race. 

Median Income: [Median Income In The Past 12 Months](https://data.census.gov/table/ACSST1Y2022.S1903?q=median%20household%20income%20by%20state)

This data set contributes to the median income in the past 12 months. We can also see previous years, but this is the other variable weâ€™re looking at to build the relationship.
